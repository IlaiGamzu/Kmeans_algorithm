# Kmeans_algorithm

Explain the Confusing Matrix
I used in heat map to see how my Logistic Regression code classification well for K classes. For each class from 10 classes I take the max index prob and compare to the actual (the real value). As we can see, the algorithm success to predicted the class compare to the actual. We can see in the diagonal that the algorithm can recognize the classes. for example in class '0' (that '1' if we start to count from '1') the algoritm has high recognized. Also we can see the classification_report table: The precision is very high, that mean the algorithm recognize in the average 84% from all the casses witch class it's belong. The recall is very high too, tmean that true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances in the data is very high. The harmonic average is combimnation of recall and presicion and also has a 84%. Also the acurecy is 84%. In addition we can see in the classification_report that the class 1 (two if count from 1) has the smallest F1-score with 0.71 and class 0 (1 if count from '1') has the biggest f1-score with 0.93. If we looking on the Confusing Matrix and the classification_report, class 5 (six if count from '1') that the "Support", the number of occurrences of each class in the true labels, is the largest then any class- 73, and also: precision- 0.87 recall-0.85 f1-score 0.86 that give the bigest true lablel compare to the prediction in "62", beacuse this the class 5 has the precent.
